/**
 * Run the work for one queue message in its own Logging Context. Call it inside
 * your own loop over `batch.messages`: it never iterates the batch, and never calls
 * `ack`, `retry`, `ackAll` or `retryAll`. Your code decides those.
 *
 * The Context Fields are `queue` (from the batch), `messageId` and `attempts`. When
 * the message body carries a Trace Carrier under `trace` (the producer sent
 * `{ ...payload, trace: getTraceCarrier() }`), the message continues the producer's
 * trace; otherwise it starts a new root trace. The body is never changed. Each call
 * is recorded as one Span, `span.end queue.message`: `INFO` with its duration, or
 * `ERROR` with `err` when `fn` throws or rejects. When the carrier's trace is not
 * sampled (flags `00`), no `span.end` is written, but a throw still writes one
 * `queue.message failed` line at `ERROR` with `err`. `fn`'s return value is returned
 * as it is, and a throw is rethrown unchanged.
 *
 * Await (or return) it from `queue`: the batch is acked implicitly when the handler
 * returns, so a call left unawaited may still be running when it is acked, and its
 * throw is lost. Running the messages concurrently with
 * `Promise.all(batch.messages.map((m) => withQueueMessage(batch, m, ...)))` is safe:
 * each call has its own Logging Context.
 *
 * The Root Logger is built from the Worker's env (read through
 * `import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'`, as `defaultLoggerFromEnv` does) with
 * `options.env`, cached per isolate, and registered as the Default Logger unless one
 * is already set (first seen wins).
 *
 * @template R - The return type of `fn`.
 * @template E - The worker environment type.
 * @param {Pick<MessageBatch, 'queue'>} batch - The batch the message came in.
 * @param {Pick<Message, 'id' | 'attempts' | 'body'>} message - The message.
 * @param {() => R} fn - The work for this message.
 * @param {HandlerOptions<E>} [options] - `env`: the Env Mapping for the Root Logger.
 * @returns {R} The return value of `fn`, unchanged.

 * execution of `run` continues that trace, so its replays share one `traceId`;
 * otherwise each execution starts a new root trace. The Root Logger is built from
 * the Workflow's env through `options.env`, cached per isolate, and registered as
 * the Default Logger in the constructor unless one is already set (first seen wins).
 *
 * `run` itself is not recorded as a Span, and a rejection of `run` is not logged:
 * the engine replays it from the top after every sleep, wait or restart, and uses
 * thrown errors for its own control flow (a pause or termination surfaces in it as a
 * throw, and no documented marker tells those apart from your errors), so one "run"
 * Span or an `ERROR` line on rejection would misreport. A throw outside every
 * `tracedStep()` (validation before the first step, code between steps, a plain
 * `step.do`) is therefore not logged by `withWorkflow`; it shows as the instance's
 * error in the Workflows dashboard. Put each unit of work in a `tracedStep()`, for one
 * Span per attempt, `ERROR` on a throw.
 *
 * Without `payload.trace`, each execution of `run` starts its own root trace, so the
 * replays of one instance have different `traceId`s; join them on
 * `workflowInstanceId`, or pass `trace: getTraceCarrier()` in the params for one
 * trace.
 *
 * Nothing about the Workflow changes: no step is added, the event, `step` and the
 * return value pass through as they are, and a throw is rethrown unchanged. `run`
 * must be a method on the class (not a class field), and the returned class should
 * be the one exported. Wrapping the result again with the same `env` returns it;

 *
 * The rollback handler re-enters the run's Logging Context the same way, as a Span
 * named `rollback <name>`, with `step`, `stepCount` and `rollback: true`. A

 * Context, so lines it writes carry no trace (keep it a pure computation).

 * object, and a callback that returns the original's value (or throws its error)
 * unchanged. The rollback options are copied (`rollbackConfig` included, as the same
